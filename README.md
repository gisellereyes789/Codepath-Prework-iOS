## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps are:

    -- Instagram
        - Easily share content via instagram as well as threads
        - Ability to merge mutliple accounts with one user
        - Ease of use
        
    -- Wallet App via Apple
        - The most intutive bank card app in my opinion
        - Shows you how much intrest you will accrue real time, depending on how much money you are paying.
        - Easily able to contact customer service seemlessly through the app
        
    -- Justin Guitar
        - Cheap
        - The instructionals are very well organized and give a beginner guitarist a roadmap of what to learn
        - Includes a metronome, tuner, and backtracks to play along
